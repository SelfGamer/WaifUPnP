# WaifUPnP 

UPnP Port Forwarding for Java couldn't be any easier!

WaifUPnP is an _extermely_ lightweight Java library that allows you to:

- open/close TCP/UDP ports
- check if there's an UPnP router available
- check if a port is already mapped

using literally 1 line of code, as it should be! 

It's as easy as:

```java
UPnP.openTCP(<port number here>, <usage name here>);
```

## Usage

- Import `WaifUPnP.jar` into your application

## Compatibility

Java 11 and newer

## Limitations

WaifUPnP is a very basic implementation of UPnP, that only scans for the default gateway, and can only open/close ports.

While this is enough for most people, if you need a full implementation of UPnP, you should take a look at [Cling](http://4thline.org/projects/cling/)
